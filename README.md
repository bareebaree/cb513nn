This is a MSc Bioinformatics project to train and test a convolutional neural network to predict protein secondary structure using DSSP3 classification (3 classes, coils, helices, sheets)

The architecture for this CNN is based off:

https://github.com/alrojo/CB513

# app.py

This file is for the Shiny Python dashboard for the project. The dashboard can be found at:

# cb513.csv 

This is the dataset used for the project and loaded into secondary_structure_CNN.py.

# secondary_structure_CNN.py

This is a python script that loads data, trains the model, and validates and tests it.
